# Session 2: Federated Analysis - Find and access data in the cloud via Data Connect and Data Repository Service (DRS)

## Outline

**Time:** Sunday, July 10th, 2022 @ 12 pm - 1 pm

**Slides:** [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zuw_KVO_TQy91ODBWYmObkc_FTkAK7iy-SETjTY5TkQ)

Participants will use python clients for GA4GH services and write scripts in Jupyter notebooks.

Participants will interact with Driver Project implementations of Data Connect and DRS to locate and access files in datasets such as TCGA, GTEx, and TopMed and run workflows against them using WES (though that could be the add in the following session).

## Tutorial

Open a terminal in your chosen python3 environment

## Session specific requirements

![python](../../supporting/images/python-icon.png)If you are using Python virtual environments and set one up for the tutorial activate that environment now.

### Install Jupyter

```

### Install fasp-clients

- Install the fasp-clients Python package from GitHub. FASP is the GA4GH Federated Analysis Systems Project.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ga4gh/fasp-clients

```

### Clone or pull the respository for this tutorial

#### Obtain an authentication token and save it to disk

Go to the Developer Menu and copy the authentication token to the clipboard 

<img src="../../supporting/images/cgc_token.png" alt="cgc_token" style="zoom:33%;" />



Open the file 

ismb-2022-ga4gh-tutorial/sessions/session2/keys/sbcgc_key.json 

Replace your_token_here with the token copied from the page above.

```json
{"auth_token" : "your_token_here"}
```

Create a folder in your home directory called .keys

Copy the sbcgc_key.json file there.

```
mkdir ~/.keys
cd sessions
cp session2/keys/sbcgc_key.json ~/.keys
```

Note: you may save the file elsewhere. If so, make a note of the location you saved it to as you will need to replace the default path later.



```
python ismb_test/test_sbcgc_auth.py ~/.keys/sbcgc_key.json
```



#### Start Jupyter

```
cd ../sessions
jupyter notebook
```
